# Conversion & Revenue Boost for Urban Food Courts

### Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for a consulting project focused on diagnosing and improving food court conversion and revenue performance for a leading Indian real estate & infrastructure conglomerate operating 25+ malls across Tier‑1 and Tier‑2 cities.

### Problem Statement

Despite mall footfall recovering to 90% of pre‑COVID levels, Tier‑2 city food courts underperform with:

- Low conversion rates (18–22%) from mall visitors to food court customers
- \~35% of kiosk inventory unsold
- Low repeat visits and dwell time

### Objectives (60‑Day Mandate)

1. Increase food court conversion rate by **15%** in Tier‑2 cities
2. Improve average order value (AOV) and sales per square foot
3. Boost kiosk occupancy through enhanced vendor onboarding and marketing support

### Scope & Constraints

- **No major layout redesigns or capex‑heavy changes** (only minor modular adjustments allowed)
- Recommendations must be backed by primary insights or secondary research (market benchmarks, case studies)
- Implementation feasibility within **30–60 days** in Tier‑2 locations

### Methodology

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Funnel analysis (mall entry → purchase → repeat)
   - Segmentation by customer persona and city tier
   - Identification of drop‑off points and key pain points
2. **Strategic Interventions**
   - Low‑cost, tech‑enabled, and operational solutions targeting awareness, appeal, access, and retention
3. **Metrics & Execution Plan**
   - Defining KPIs for each recommendation (conversion %, AOV, stall utilization)
   - Pilot rollout plan for 2 test locations with estimated budget, timeline, and expected ROI
